# A Dijkstra-based Path Planners

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of path planning algorithms based on Dijkstra's algorithm and A* algorithm for grid-based environments.

## Contents

- **AStarGrid.m**: Implementation of the A* algorithm for grid-based pathfinding.
- **DijkstraGrid.m**: Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for grid-based pathfinding.
- **run.m**: Script to run and test the path planning algorithms.

## Features

- Path planning in grid-based environments
- Visualization of the pathfinding process
- Customizable start and goal positions

## Usage

- Run the script:
    ```sh
    run.m
    ```
